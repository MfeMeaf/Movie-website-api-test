# Your local movie trailer website
## What is this website?
*This was a mini project to test and get used to using API's*
## Am I satisfied with the website relative to the 
The website itself went according to the requirements specification form except a few changes in the general way that information is shown on the website however the finished version is satisfactory to the standards I set on myself "mainly the functionallity part of the project"
### Originial sketch

### Finished Version

As for the trailer part of the website it is essenstially the same as the sketch except that instead of a review it displays the synopsis of the movie and the name of the movie
Due to the API used not having all the information I originally wanted I adapted to fitting the website to work around it 

-*Since I also couldn't find a suitable API that could get the information I wanted without trading something else off* 
The general styling of the website could be better but I think that the simplistic design works and doesn't overclutter with unnecessary information / items

The work flow during the project steady except during the start when I was looking for a decent API "Not all of them have a good response time and trailers"
